1) translate to my format the cohomologies from maple
2) take parametric p-cohomology for p in [1,2] (range(1,3))
3) drop from the domain (p-cohomology) everything that contains x7
4) use lefschetz mapping on the element of base p-cohomology:
	-compute d on each. 
	-compute * on each, d* on each
	-projection

//BETTER CHOICE:
/// all in maple:
-compute cohomology OK 
-check L.B. for p=1,2 so for H^{3-p},H^{3+p} i.e. H2&H4 and H1&H5 
-compute dx7, dx7^dx7 [p=1,2] (maybe additionally n^(dx7^p)?) OK
-take elements not containing x7 from H2,H1 and map them through Lefschetz
	-> n^dn^proj (or not proj?)
	-> to get proj we need to compute d & d* for each element of H2, H1 
	   and pick adequately 0 or form (so in fact this is restricting to 
	   harmonic, other map to 0).
	-> to compute the * I'll use definiton from BÄ…k paper:
		-psi*phi_inv, phi is i_X\dn->1-form, psi is i_X\(dn)^3
		 ("volume form")
		-hence need to compute (dn)^3

	-> once we have it apply LefschetzB so compute (dn^p)^proj
	-> see the 2 corresponding sets of domain and image and check 
	   isomorphism (maybe pass to SageMath)
